# Digital-Logic-Design-Sim
Digital Logic Design Simulator made using Unity and C#.
## Information
A 2D Digital Logic Design Simulator developed using Unity and C#, allowing users to explore and experiment with combinational logic circuits. This simulator is designed for educational purposes and practical learning in digital logic principles. This simulator only implements combinational logic at the moment, with plans to add sequential logic implementation in the future. AND, OR, NOR, NAND, NOT, XOR, XNOR gates are present in this simulator and can be used easily.

## Usage
To use the Digital Design Simulator:
1. Open the project in Unity.
2. Start the simulator and use the "Block" tool to place gates.
3. Connect inputs and outputs using the "Pencil" tool.
4. Modify input states with the "Mouse" tool.
5. Use the "Cut" tool to remove unwanted connections or gates.
6. Complete your circuit and observe the outputs.

## Example
A Full-adder circuit that was constructed using the simulator is demonstrated in the video below:
